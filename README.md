# Some cpp files that are made
They go over many different core concepts of c++ language. 
Note: Not all of these files are going to work, as this repo is just for educational purpose.

You can use your typical c++ compiler like gcc or clang to comile the binary files and run them. 

Hope this helps ya
have a nice day.
